            <h3>Smart eye blindness for impaired people</h3>
            <p>Blind mobility is one of the major challenges encountered by visually impaired persons in their daily lives. Their life and activities are greatly restricted by loss of eyesight. They normally travel using blind navigation system or by their accumulated memories in their long-term exploration. The main objective of the present work is to develop a low cost, reliable, portable, user friendly, low power and robust solution for visually impaired people. (Smart Glasses for Blind People), as meant are the glasses are for visually impaired people. It has an in-built sensor in it which spreads ultrasonic waves in the direction the person is going by scanning at most 5-6 meters of 30ยบ range. As soon as the obstacle is detected, the sensor detects it and sends it to the device which generates an automated voice in the earphone connected to the person's ear.</p>
